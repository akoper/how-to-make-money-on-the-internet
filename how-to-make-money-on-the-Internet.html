    <h1>How to Make Money on the Internet</h1>
    <p>My friend Julie has a unique life skill set. I decided to do some research online to see how people can make
        money with social media and the Internet, to share with her, to try and help her create her dream job and make a
        living
        doing what she wants/loves to do. I decided to publish this online to share with/help other people, too.</p>
    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p>Social media has obviously become a major part of the Internet in the 21st Century, with major platforms like having billions of users globally. The social media companies have spent money
        trying to help creators get money for their content.</p>

    <h4>Selling with Social Media</h4>
    <h2>Selling online</h2>
        <p>This takes more work - to learn a company's policies and create a product - but selling something online is the normal? way
        to make money online.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Advertising on Content</h2>
        <p>It almost seems antiquated now, but one of the first ways to make money online was to put an ad network on
            your pages or content, show ads on your content
            (the more views your pages or content get, the more ads they show, and the more click-throughs they get), and get paid by the advertising company</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Internet changes relatively rapidly</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Social is so huge, powerful and popular, many companies and sites are making their applications more social,
            creating new social opportunities with things are that "aren't social."</li>
        <li>Half of the most popular apps in the world - WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, Telegram, etc. - are messaging apps.
            People don't normally make money with messaging apps, but maybe there's a way?</li>
        <li>If a new platform emerges, it's hard if not impossible to get more followers than the most
        famous people on the biggest platforms, but people who are the first to new things
        can get an inordinate amount of attention and followers. </li>
    </ul>
